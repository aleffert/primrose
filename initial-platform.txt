The first question when starting a software project is:
    What platform is this targetted at?

Which in turn asks a more basic question: What are the requirements?

Basic conflict: The iPad is in some sense, natural medium for this, but ultimately I'd like to be more cross platform.

No matter what, we'll need to build libraries for constructing pages or sections or something. The question is, is that a set of libraries in some language or a custom document format.

Choices:
- Obj-C
    + Comfortable
    + Good APIs
    + Ideal for books
    - Bad distribution story
    - Bad cross platofrm story

- HTML/CSS
    - Terrible support for sound.
    - No types.
    + Universal

- Flash
    + Cross platform
    + Has the APIs
    + Dying

- Libraries for haXe?
    - Need to build an abstraction layer for display
    - Doesn't target iPad

- Something custom
    + More fun.
    + Can be retargetted.
    - Much more work up front.
    - Unclear what is necessary at this point.

It seems like I really want to build an authoring tool, but that I'm not ready to do that yet.

Conclusion:
    Chapter 1 is done in ObjC. Use that to determine what the custom thing should be.
