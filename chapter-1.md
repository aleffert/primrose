*** How to talk to fireflies ***

It was a rainy day.

It was a rainy week.

It was a rainy month.

It was a rainy year.

There was no electricity. School had been cancelled for a looooong time. Jack was very bored. 

If Jack wanted to see something after dark he had go up to the roof and look at it in the moonlight.

Big bright full mooons are rare. Most moons are half moons or crescents or gibbouses - whatever those are. The only other light on the roof was the scattered glow of fireflies. But they were always moving around never stayed lit for very long. Still, they were all Jack had, so he was determined to experiment.
